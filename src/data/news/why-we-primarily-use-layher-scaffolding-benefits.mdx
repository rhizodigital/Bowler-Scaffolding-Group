At Bowler Scaffolding Group, we primarily work with Layher scaffolding, a world-renowned system that sets the benchmark for innovation and quality. While we favour Layher for its numerous advantages, we also use traditional tube and fitting scaffolding when project requirements call for it. Here's why Layher is our go-to choice and how our flexible approach benefits our customers.

#### Superior Safety Standards

Safety is at the heart of everything we do, and Layher scaffolding offers exceptional reliability. Its precision-engineered design ensures structural integrity and minimises human error during assembly. Each component locks securely, creating a robust framework that exceeds industry safety standards. However, when complex or bespoke structures require traditional tube and fitting, our experienced team ensures that safety remains paramount regardless of the system used.

#### Faster and More Efficient Assembly

Compared to traditional tube and fitting scaffolding, Layher's modular system allows for significantly faster assembly. Its pre-engineered components fit together seamlessly, reducing build times by up to 50%. This efficiency helps us complete projects more quickly, minimising site disruption and lowering labour costs. Even when we use tube and fitting for specialised tasks, our expertise ensures timely and efficient execution.

#### Unmatched Versatility

Layher scaffolding is incredibly versatile, adapting to even the most challenging architectural designs. Its modularity allows for creative and complex configurations that are often difficult to achieve with traditional scaffolding systems. For projects where Layher isn't the ideal fit, we seamlessly integrate tube and fitting scaffolding to deliver bespoke solutions tailored to your specific needs.

#### Clean and Professional Appearance

For high-profile projects or public-facing sites where aesthetics matter, Layher scaffolding offers a clean, uniform look that stands out from traditional scaffolding systems. That said, when traditional tube and fitting is the better option, our skilled team ensures a professional finish, maintaining the highest standards of presentation and functionality.

#### Durability and Sustainability

Layher scaffolding is built from high-quality materials designed to withstand the test of time. Its durability ensures consistent performance, while its sustainable manufacturing process reduces waste and environmental impact. When we use tube and fitting, we apply the same commitment to quality, reusing materials whenever possible to minimise environmental impact.

#### Cost-Effective Solutions

While Layher scaffolding represents an investment in advanced technology, its efficiency and adaptability make it highly cost-effective. Faster assembly and reduced labour requirements translate into savings for our clients. When tube and fitting scaffolding is more suitable, we ensure it's deployed efficiently to keep costs competitive while maintaining safety and quality.

#### Why Layher is Our Preferred Choice

While other system scaffolding brands offer modularity, Layher stands out for its precision engineering, safety features, and continuous innovation. However, we recognise that no single system fits every project. That's why we maintain the flexibility to use both Layher and traditional tube and fitting scaffolding, ensuring the right solution for every scenario.

### Conclusion

By primarily using Layher scaffolding and complementing it with traditional tube and fitting when needed, Bowler Scaffolding Group delivers superior scaffolding solutions. Faster assembly, enhanced safety, and cost efficiency are just some of the benefits you can expect. Whether it's a construction site, an event, or a complex architectural challenge, our versatile approach ensures your project is completed smoothly, safely, and to the highest standards.
