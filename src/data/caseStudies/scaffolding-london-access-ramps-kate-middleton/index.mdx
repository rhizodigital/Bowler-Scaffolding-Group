**Case Study: Bowler Scaffolding Group Provides Access Solutions for the Duchess of Cambridge’s Visit to the Natural History Museum**

**Project Overview**  
Bowler Scaffolding Group was honoured to be selected to provide essential access solutions for the high-profile unveiling of *Hope*, the blue whale skeleton at the Natural History Museum in London. The event, attended by Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge and the renowned naturalist Sir David Attenborough, required precise planning and execution to ensure safe and seamless access for all attendees.

**The Challenge**  
The Natural History Museum needed a temporary yet secure access system to facilitate the movement of the Duchess of Cambridge and her aides. A key requirement was an access ramp to allow the Duchess and her team to move safely around to the front of the museum and onto a red carpet. The solutions had to blend into the museum’s historic architecture while ensuring safety and accessibility. The project also required strict adherence to security and logistical constraints due to the presence of high-profile figures and media coverage.

**Our Solution**  
Bowler Scaffolding Group designed and installed a bespoke access system that included:
- **Access Ramp**: A custom-built ramp designed to ensure the safe and smooth movement of the Duchess and her aides onto the red carpet.
- **Handrails**: Secure, durable handrails were installed along all access points, providing additional stability and support.
- **Discreet Integration**: The structures were designed to complement the museum’s aesthetic, using high-quality materials that matched the surroundings.
- **Compliance & Safety**: All installations met stringent safety regulations and were rigorously tested before the event.

**Execution & Outcome**  
Our team worked within a tight timeframe, liaising closely with museum officials and event organisers to ensure flawless execution. The access ramp and handrails were installed efficiently and dismantled promptly after the event, causing minimal disruption to the museum’s daily operations.

The project was a resounding success, ensuring that the Duchess of Cambridge and her aides were able to navigate the event safely and comfortably.
