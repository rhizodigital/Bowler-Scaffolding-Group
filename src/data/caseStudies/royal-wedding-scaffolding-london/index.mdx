**Project Overview**
Bowler Scaffolding Group was honoured to play a pivotal role in one of the most globally watched events—the royal wedding of Kate Middleton and Prince William in London. We were commissioned to design and construct the camera towers and viewing platform structures, ensuring stable, high-visibility positions for media broadcasters and key attendees.

**Project Scope & Challenges**
The event required a large-scale, precisely engineered scaffolding system to accommodate the world’s leading broadcasters, photographers, and VIP spectators. Our role was to create temporary structures that would provide optimal camera angles while maintaining safety and structural integrity.

The key challenges included:
- **Structural Stability & Load Management**: The camera towers needed to support heavy broadcasting equipment and multiple operators while ensuring zero movement or vibrations that could impact live footage.
- **Historic Venue Constraints**: Working within the prestigious grounds in central London required meticulous planning to avoid damage to historic architecture. Special care was taken when designing the structures around the Queen Victoria Memorial in front of Buckingham Palace, ensuring no impact on the historic monument while maintaining the best possible sightlines for media coverage.
- **Crowd & Security Considerations**: The event drew millions of spectators, necessitating careful coordination with security teams to ensure safe access and egress for both the media and the public.
- **Strict Timelines**: The entire installation had to be completed well in advance, with no room for errors, given the significance of the event.

**Our Approach**
Utilising our expertise in large-scale event scaffolding, we designed and installed a series of elevated platforms and reinforced camera towers that met all safety and functional requirements. Our team:
- Engineered a robust Layher system scaffolding solution that provided exceptional stability.
- Designed platforms with strategic positioning to offer perfect sightlines for media coverage.
- Worked closely with event organisers, security, and broadcasters to ensure a seamless build process.
- Used specialist materials to reduce the visual impact of the structures while maintaining strength and durability.

**Outcome & Impact**
The success of this project reinforced Bowler Scaffolding Group’s reputation as a trusted provider for high-profile, globally significant events. The flawless execution of our camera towers and viewing platforms contributed to the seamless worldwide broadcast of the royal wedding, ensuring millions of viewers had a perfect view of the historic occasion in London.
