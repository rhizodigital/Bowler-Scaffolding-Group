#### Project Overview

We provided Layher system scaffolding for a domestic customer installing solar panels on their property. The scaffolding ensured safe and efficient access for the solar panel installation team while protecting the property during the work.

#### Scope of Work

- Erected Layher system scaffolding for secure access to the roof.
- Provided a stable working platform for the solar panel fitters.
- Ensured minimal disruption to the homeowner while maintaining safety and efficiency.

#### Outcome

The job was completed successfully, enabling the installation team to fit the solar panels safely and on schedule. Our team dismantled the scaffolding promptly, leaving the property tidy and the customer satisfied.
