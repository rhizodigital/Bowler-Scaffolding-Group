**Project Overview**
Bowler Scaffolding Group was commissioned by London-based events company Studio Boum to construct a striking three-storey scaffold staircase to showcase Khalid Qasimi’s new AW men’s clothing collection in the run-up to London Fashion Week (15-18 February). 

**Project Scope & Challenges**
The event took place at Collins Music Hall in Islington, a derelict concrete structure that provided a raw, urban backdrop, perfectly complementing Qasimi’s latest designs. Our role was to design and install a metal scaffolding staircase that not only served as a functional access solution but also enhanced the visual experience of the show.

The key challenges included:
- **Aesthetic & Structural Balance**: The staircase needed to blend seamlessly with the cold, industrial atmosphere while maintaining stability and safety.
- **Venue Constraints**: The aged and weathered structure of Collins Music Hall required precise planning to integrate the scaffolding without causing damage.
- **Tight Schedule**: The installation had to be completed within a short timeframe to align with the London Fashion Week showcase.

**Our Approach**
We utilised our Layher system scaffold to construct a robust yet visually impactful staircase that complemented the dystopian feel of the show. The structure provided a dramatic focal point while ensuring the safe movement of models, crew, and attendees.

Our team:
- Designed a modular scaffold staircase to fit the unique space constraints of Collins Music Hall.
- Ensured rapid assembly and dismantling in line with the event schedule.
- Implemented rigorous safety measures to accommodate high foot traffic.
- Worked closely with Studio Boum to ensure the scaffold aligned with the creative vision of the show.

**Outcome & Impact**
The installation received widespread praise, reinforcing the growing demand for our Layher system scaffold staircases in the fashion industry. These structures not only provide safe and practical access but also serve as key design elements that elevate the visual appeal of runway shows and presentations.

Bowler Scaffolding Group continues to collaborate with fashion and event organisers to deliver innovative, high-quality scaffolding solutions for the industry.
